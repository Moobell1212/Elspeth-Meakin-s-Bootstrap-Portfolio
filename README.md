# Elspeth-Meakin-s-Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This is a bootstrap version of my profile for a more adaptable website minimising the need for media queries. It will showcase my past front end development projects, as well as providing my contact information. There will be an image or avatar of myself, and active links to both the website and their respective GitHub repositories. As new projects are completed, they will be added to this webiste, as well as the newest CV. This webiste is also adaptive to different screen sizes.


## Usage

The website will contain a bootstrap navigation bar which will link to the corresponding parts of the website.
