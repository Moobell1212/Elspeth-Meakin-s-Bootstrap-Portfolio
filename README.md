# Elspeth-Meakin-s-Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This is a bootstrap version of my profile for a more adaptable website minimising the need for media queries. It will showcase my past front end development projects, as well as providing my contact information. There will be an image or avatar of myself, and active links to both the website and their respective GitHub repositories. As new projects are completed, they will be added to this webiste, as well as the newest CV. This webiste is also adaptive to different screen sizes.


## Usage

The website will contain a bootstrap navigation bar which will link to the corresponding parts of the website.

The website has a hero section with my picture, my name, and other information about me.

The website has a work section which has my past work displayed using bootstrap cards in a grid.

The website has a section which lists my current and future skills, and more information about me.

There is a footer section with contact buttons which display hover effects.

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
